# React Authentication using Firebase (new API v9)

Reactjs authentication using firebase auth (using the new v9 API). The benefit of using this new API is that the final bundle size is much smaller compared to the previous - which in turn makes your React site efficient and load much faster.

## Why this?

You can use this template as a starting point for any application that needs authentication.

The template is based on [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) (incl. **Dark Mode**), though you can use any UI library you like but you need to do the relevant changes and keep the code related to firebase authentication - **the logic remains the same in any UI**.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

_**Note**: Before running `npm start` do place the relevant environment variables in the `.env.local` file for firebase configuration._
